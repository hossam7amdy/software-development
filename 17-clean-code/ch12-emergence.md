# Chapter 12: Emergence

**Getting clean via emergent design**. It posits that following **four simple rules** can aid in creating good designs as you work. These rules are meant to provide insights into the structure and design of your code, making it easier to apply principles such as the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) and the Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP), ultimately facilitating the emergence of good designs.

The four simple design rules are presented as follows:

- **Simple Design Rule 1: Runs All the Tests** .
- **Simple Design Rules 2â€“4: Refactoring** . These include:
  - **No Duplication** .
  - **Expressive** .
  - **Minimal Classes and Methods** .

The chapter concludes by stating that by adhering to these four rules, good design can emerge .
