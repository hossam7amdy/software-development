This example demonstrates how to implement batching and caching mechanisms for API requests in Node.js to improve performance and reduce server load.

## Description

The application showcases:

- Request batching to consolidate multiple similar requests
- Caching implementation to store and retrieve previous results
- Callback-based API optimization techniques

## Implementation Details

- Batching mechanism to group similar requests within a time window
- In-memory caching to store API responses
- Error handling and request timeout management

## Running the Example

1. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

2. Run the application:

```bash
node index.js
```

## Key Concepts

- Request batching strategies
- Cache implementation and management
- Performance optimization techniques
- Callback pattern usage
