# 06-react-stateful-component

This example demostrates how to build a simple React hello world application.

## Dependencies

Install all the necessary dependencies with:

```bash
npm install
```

## Run

To run the example in the browser (interactively):

```bash
npm start # or node_modules/.bin/webpack-dev-server --config webpack.config.cjs
```

Alternatively, you can build a static version of the frontend app with:

```bash
npm run build # or node_modules/.bin/webpack --config webpack.config.cjs
```

Then you can open the file `dist/index.html` with your favorite browser.
